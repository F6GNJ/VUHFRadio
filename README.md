VUHF USB Radio Module

This is a firmware for a VUHF Radio Module based on the AX5043.
To achieve both VHF and UHF on the same board it uses two AX5043 IC’s. 

Some characteristics of this firmware:
-	Costume AX5043 Library, Read/Write to it’s registers with a function to get or set each register
-	AX5043 Library Supports Multiple AX5043 Chips, multiple SPI Interfaces
-	The MCU used is an STM32F103 and this firmware uses mostly the LL Library, except the VCP (Virtual COM) Library is using HAL
-	Command interface is based on AT commands with a custom interpreter Library

Current version is tested and works with:
- AX.25 Frames with HDLC and CRC handled in the radio.
- AFSK-1200: RX and TX compatible with HAM Radios using a TNC
- (G)MSK/(G)FSK: Both RX and TX, tested @ 9600 bits/s MSK and GMSK (with BT of 0.5 and 0.3)
- BPSK: Only RX working so far, TX has to high distortion currently
- AM Demodulation output by the DAC

Results like spectrums and input matching can be found on my website: www.notblackmagic.com/projects/vuhf-radio/
