# VUHFRadio Module

This is a firmware for a VUHFRadio Module based on the AX5043.
To achieve both VHF and UHF on the same board it uses two AX5043 ICs. 

Some characteristics of this firmware:
-	Custom AX5043 Library, Read/Write to itâ€™s registers with a function to get or set each register
-	AX5043 Library Supports Multiple AX5043 Chips, multiple SPI Interfaces
-	The MCU used is an STM32F103 and this firmware uses mostly the LL Library, except the VCP (Virtual COM) Library is using HAL
-	Command interface is based on CAT commands, similar to what is used in popular HAM Radios from Yaesu or Kenwood
-   Packet/frame interface based on the KISS protocol

Current version is tested and works with:
- AX.25 Frames with HDLC and CRC handled in the radio and sent to PC (USB) using the KISS protocol
- AFSK-1200: RX and TX compatible with HAM Radios using a TNC. Tested with RTL.SDR and SDR# output to SoundModem.
- FSK-9600 (G3RUH): RX and TX compatible with HAM Radios using a TNC. Tested with RTL.SDR and SDR# output to SoundModem HS.
- (G)MSK/(G)FSK: Both RX and TX, tested @ 9600 bits/s MSK and GMSK (with BT of 0.5 and 0.3)
- BPSK: Now working as well, both RX and TX
- Morse decoding using the RSSI tracking
- AM and FM Demodulation output by the DAC
- FM Modulation from ADC input
